          <p>This website has come a long way since my first fumblings on the now defunct Geocities. That was the cause of my giving a scanner a go for the very first time, not mine as it happened. 
          Acquiring one of my own meant that increased the number of photos to be found on that very first website and an online photo gallery was born. From a single pleasing first photo, it has grown.
          There are now numerous albums showing delightful scenes from Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and Canada.
          </p>
		  <p>My foreign wanderings may increase but I want to continue the mix of urban and rural scenes here. Neither do I want to neglect the home countries of Britain and Ireland after all the
		  pleasure gained from excursions through alluring countryside as well as to savour pleasing towns and cities. There is more to savour here too.

          <p><a class="btn btn-default teaser" href="/outdoors" role="button">Read Blog &raquo;</a></p>
          <p>Before the blog existed, there was a news page listing recent trips as a teaser for future additions to the photo gallery. Then, I started a blog to see if this concept 
          could be taken further, only for it then to take on a life of its own after following an unexpected course encouraged by reader comments.</p>
          <p>What I had not realised at the outset was the appetite that those who walk through countryside have for each others' tales of their own wanderings. Starting out early in outdoors blogging 
          helped to get my writings noticed with comments from regular readers shaping how the blog has developed since I started it. Also, that encouragement not only has kept me going out and about 
          but also sharing experiences and thoughts inspired by my exploring European countryside together with that of any other continents that I may reach. There always is somewhere new to wander.

          <p><a class="btn btn-default teaser" href="/travel" role="button">Explore Jottings &raquo;</a></p>
          <p>In its own way, this part of the website reflects the increased internationalisation of my explorations in recent years. What started out life as a directory of British and Irish visitor
          information still fulfils a lot of that intent but also with added insights from encounters with other parts of the world and any preceding research.</p>
          <p>One thing that I never realised is just how different exploring a whole country is from doing the same in one where you already live. Being in a place all the time means that you encounter
          something new on an ongoing basis while going further afield means that the learning tends to happen all at once. Sights are as much urban as they are rural so that mix is reflected here too.
          The collection also includes personal experiences along with a little something more photographic. Variety is the essence and it looks as if that's how it's going to stay.</p>
