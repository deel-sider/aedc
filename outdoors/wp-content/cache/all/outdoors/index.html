However, the result of my exertions was an offer for my freelance services that clashed with another opportunity that came to nothing. The offer was accepted despite warnings that it could be rescinded. The coming week will show whether that was a bluff or not.</p><p>All this was happening during the first real sign of heat that we experienced this year; the hot, sunny weather was a foretaste of summer. There were local strolls in the midst of the frenzy, a necessity for keeping my mind in order throughout all of it. My mind even turned to a Scottish incursion centred on Inverness that would have allowed a visit to Fionn Bheinn near Achnasheen as well as a stroll from Drumnadrochit back to Inverness along part of the Great Glen Way.</p><p>However, there was too much happening to allow the getaway to become a reality. A hotel booking was cancelled after learning that the weather was not as enticing as I might have desired during a sequence of simplification. Having the prospects for another time will do no harm, though. Ideas are not so plentiful in my head as I write these words, anyway.</p><p>Business is set to return me to Geneva for a conference, which will be handy for getting to see the place again. The initial motivation for all of this was making connections for securing freelance work as well as building up my knowledge. Some of that may be less pressing after the past week, though it will be good to get out among colleagues again. Wandering the city in pleasant sunshine will be a bonus too.</p><p>These are times when being a solopreneur can be isolating, especially when trying to source work in a challenging market. Thus, it is just as well that the wonders of nature at springtime offer much needed solace and consolation. While my wanderings may be curtailed this year, any such encounter only spurs desire for deeper incursions. There may be time for those later.</p></div><div class="post mb-5"><h2 class="mb-4"><a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/quiet-but-not-quiet/">Quiet, but not quiet</a></h2> <small class="mb-1">15<sup>th</sup> April 2025</small> <small class="mb-4"></small><p>2025 has not been working out for me as I might have hoped. The return to freelancing is not going smoothly, and is weighing on my mind. Thus, I have not been able to make use of the interludes of sunny weather like I would have done last year or in preceding years.</p><p>A disappointment was enough to prompt weekend visits to Edinburgh and London that were worthwhile. Beyond that and fleeting visits to my place in Ireland, I have not summoned the energy to venture into the countryside as much as I did around the New Year period, when I even embarked on a day trip to Killarney before a spell of wintry weather confined many of us in Ireland. A preceding amble around Kinsale took me along muddying paths, yet granted the fresh air respite that I needed at the time. Blarney was another place that offered much on brief incursions.</p><p>A fit of January hubris had me booking a North American holiday that I have now cancelled. Though the deposit has been lost, that was not much anyway and used up points that I had been accumulating. The extravagant delights of being sojourned in Toronto can wait. If anything happens during the summer, it is more likely European, given all the ongoing upheaval. The need for marketing and education is luring me to Geneva for a week in any case.</p><p>A possible client engagement could have taken me to Lausanne for a site visit, only for their deciding to go about things another way. The market in freelance work is proving challenging. A preceding fear of getting bombarded, like I did nearly seven years ago, thankfully has come to nothing. Desolate recollections of how things went on the transition from university to work are haunting me now as I consider my options for the future.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Easter weekend is coming and may offer chances for wandering in some countryside. That depends on what weather we are given and my freeing up my mind for at least a while; lulls, once seen as respite, now feel like desertion. A time when one could plan further in advance is behind us for now.</p></div><div class="post mb-5"><h2 class="mb-4"><a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/revisiting-the-fairfield-horseshoe-a-stirring-trek-through-some-of-the-lake-districts-craggy-beauty/">Revisiting the Fairfield Horseshoe: A stirring trek through some of the Lake District&#8217;s craggy beauty</a></h2> <small class="mb-1">17<sup>th</sup> January 2025</small> <small class="mb-4"></small><p>The overriding memory of July 2022 is that of the record-breaking temperatures endured during the middle of the month. In hindsight, it would have been more productive not to have tried working through this at all, telling my client as much at the time. Scarcely anything could be accomplished in these conditions.</p><p>Not having air conditioning in a terraced cottage in the north of England was no preparation for temperatures exceeding 30° C around the clock, which meant that nights largely were sleepless as a result. Having a place near the coast in Ireland might have made for a good holdout while this was happening, something that only came into my possession last year, two years too late for that episode.</p><p>Before all that meteorological fury, I scurried north to the Lake District for a day hike. The destination was inspired by reappraisal of photos in my online gallery, a pervasive trend throughout 2022. It had been the most of twenty years since I first completed the Fairfield; a reprise came not before time. Since film photography was my mainstay back then, this was an opportunity to engage in some digital capture of what is found around there while following a similar route.</p><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13841" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2593_sharpened.jpg" alt="Revisiting the Fairfield Horseshoe: A stirring trek through some of the Lake District&#039;s craggy beauty" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2593_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2593_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2593_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13841" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2593_sharpened.jpg" alt="Revisiting the Fairfield Horseshoe: A stirring trek through some of the Lake District&#039;s craggy beauty" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2593_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2593_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2593_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p><img decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13842" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2595_sharpened.jpg" alt="Revisiting the Fairfield Horseshoe: A stirring trek through some of the Lake District&#039;s craggy beauty" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2595_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2595_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2595_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13842" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2595_sharpened.jpg" alt="Revisiting the Fairfield Horseshoe: A stirring trek through some of the Lake District&#039;s craggy beauty" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2595_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2595_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2595_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>The preceding night may not have been as restful as I might have liked, yet I got to Rydal at around 10:00. On that round all those years ago, there were fewer people around until I got as far as Fairfield. The reprise was busier, especially on the ascent of Nab Scar, where the steep slopes caused others to clump together on rest breaks. Even at that stage of the day, there was summer heat to be felt, so the ascent was sweaty work.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13843" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2616_sharpened.jpg" alt="Revisiting the Fairfield Horseshoe: A stirring trek through some of the Lake District&#039;s craggy beauty" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2616_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2616_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2616_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13843" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2616_sharpened.jpg" alt="Revisiting the Fairfield Horseshoe: A stirring trek through some of the Lake District&#039;s craggy beauty" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2616_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2616_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2616_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13844" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2622_sharpened.jpg" alt="Revisiting the Fairfield Horseshoe: A stirring trek through some of the Lake District&#039;s craggy beauty" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2622_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2622_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2622_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13844" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2622_sharpened.jpg" alt="Revisiting the Fairfield Horseshoe: A stirring trek through some of the Lake District&#039;s craggy beauty" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2622_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2622_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2622_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>When the gradients relented, I found somewhere to stop for a while to take on board some refreshments and savouring views of Rydal Water, Loughrigg Fell, Grasmere and whatever else lay about me. Because it was likely that there was a bolus all staring at once that morning, I left others pass on their way. One joked that they were on their second way around when they passed me again after my overtaking them during the initial ascent. It might have been prompted by the pandemic strictures easing substantially, but there was a feeling of added camaraderie on this round.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13845" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2655_sharpened.jpg" alt="Revisiting the Fairfield Horseshoe: A stirring trek through some of the Lake District&#039;s craggy beauty" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2655_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2655_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2655_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13845" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2655_sharpened.jpg" alt="Revisiting the Fairfield Horseshoe: A stirring trek through some of the Lake District&#039;s craggy beauty" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2655_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2655_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2655_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>Once I got going again, Heron Pike was my next landmark. With everyone now more scattered, each could have more space, and that also applied to me. The going was now gentler than before and greater views were opening around me. It never ceases to amaze me how stiff the first few hundred metres of an ascent can be, only for things to ease off once you are higher up; then everything can feel a little more plateau like. This can catch you at the end of a descent too, as I found on this hike, and glacial action often is the cause of such arduous going.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden

was my next staging post as I navigated the undulations atop a narrowing ridgeline; gradients again stiffened on the final approach to the summit to open up more views for me. To my left lay the narrow valley leading up to Grisedale Hause and then Grisedale Tarn. It was a scene showing the latter that I had in my mind&#8217;s eye for its capture using newer technology than I had all those years ago. The further up and the further in that I went, the more that I got to savour.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13851"

top of Great Rigg, I was not done with uphill gradients just yet. The last heave on the way to the flat top of Fairfield needed to be surmounted first. Patience was in order at this point before things became much kinder. On the way, I could glimpse my return route as it threaded between Dove Crag, Hart Crag and other eminences. Once on the top, the high point of my day&#8217;s walking, I could glimpse St. Sunday Crag and Helvellyn to the north. The former was <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/an-occasion-when-resolve-got-rewarded-wandering-from-the-shore-of-ullswater-to-the-heart-of-grasmere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the subject of a yomp around eight years before</a>, and the end of August would see me surmount the latter. There was topological majesty in every direction anyone could face, all brightly lit on the day.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full

greatest height of your day, the only way is down, not that such a reality means that it gets easier from there. Initially, the inclines were kind enough, and I could peer into Patterdale and make out the outline of Place Fell, <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/departing-with-one-plan-arriving-with-another/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a summit I surmounted in January 2010</a> at the start of a year of career turbulence for me. The list of fell tops that I would cross became Hart Crag, Dove Crag, High Pike and Low Pike.</p><p>It was after the penultimate of these that gradients again stiffened, that being my lot until I reached the floor of Scandale at High Sweden Bridge. Walking poles were essential for saving some knee strain, and patient foot placement was my lot while allowing the fleeter of foot to pass me; everyone has to hike their own hike. For a time, it seemed easier to follow the informal path by the stone wall instead of seeking out the line of the public footpath.</p><p>That came to an end when a challenging down scramble lay before me. Then, I sought out the public right of way to High Sweden Bridge, leaving the topological drama of High Brock Crags and Low Brock Crags behind me. This also left a walking group to go their way, possibly towards Low Sweden Bridge, mine turning out to be a quieter affair; the rest of the descent to Ambleside was now at hand. This broad track better suited wearied limbs, allowing patient progress to convey me safely onto busier streets, where I sought out the main bus stop after a satisfying day.</p><p>In summary, I had experienced what I came to encounter, making many images and enjoying the round. Though I normally seek quietude, the moments of shared camaraderie added its own special moments too. Any challenge posed by the warmth of the day has faded from recollection now; it was a scenic grandeur that stood out for me. This was a reprise more than worth doing as it took me around places that I have frequented before. It was great to see them all again.</p><h4>Travel Arrangements</h4><p>A return train trip from Macclesfield got me to Windermere. From there, I had a choice of bus routes for getting to Rydal for the start of the hike. The same applied for getting from Ambleside to Windermere. You can use either service 555 or 599 for this; the latter goes between Bowness-on-Windermere and Grasmere, while the former goes between Lancaster and Keswick.</p></div><div class="post mb-5"><h2 class="mb-4"><a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/hiking-lofty-helvellyn-a-commendable-scenic-detour-on-the-way-to-scotland/">Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland</a></h2> <small class="mb-1">15<sup>th</sup> January 2025</small> <small class="mb-4"></small><p>2022 was the year when I really began to emerge following the constraints of the pandemic. Trips to Ireland allowed me to become reaccustomed to staying away from home, as well as seeing more of the place than I had before then. While there had been day trips to the South Pennines, Wales and the Lake District, none had featured a stay away from home in the U.K. before the end of August.</p><p>My not having been in Scotland since 2019 was what drew me north. Other than having a client meeting, I cannot explain why I did not take Friday as a non-working day for travel to Stirling. That might have got me some better days for hiking up there, negating the return visits that I have described in other trip reports on here. We live our lives with so much unknowing.</p><p>Another complication was the performance of Avanti West Coast and Transpennine Express. Both operators were unable to operate their full timetables because of staffing challenges, resulting in many cancellations. That, and the Friday evening travel time, meant that I spent two nights in Carlisle, facilitating the third (and final) Lake District day hike of the year. Having pondered an ascent of Helvellyn during July, that became my choice. Terry Abraham&#8217;s Life of a Mountain: Helvellyn was one inspiration behind that endeavour, and I reaped the rewards of my day around the Cumbrian landmark.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13823" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4455_sharpened.jpg" alt="Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4455_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4455_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4455_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13823" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4455_sharpened.jpg" alt="Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4455_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4455_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4455_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>On Saturday, I headed to Glenridding from Carlisle, first by train as far as Penrith and then by bus from there. Car parks were full and visitors were struggling to find a space as I made my way towards Greenside Road, a gravel track despite the name. At one point, I found myself being asked if I was leaving, meaning that I was freeing up a space for someone. My mode of travel meant that I was no help in that regard, and I carried on from there to quieter surroundings. The sunny weather, the long weekend and the still reduced nature of international air travel all contributed to the busyness as much as the proximity of Ullswater and the surrounding fells.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13824" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4473_sharpened.jpg" alt="Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4473_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4473_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4473_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13824" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4473_sharpened.jpg" alt="Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4473_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4473_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4473_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13825" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4474_sharpened.jpg" alt="Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4474_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4474_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4474_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13825" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4474_sharpened.jpg" alt="Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4474_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4474_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4474_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>Thankfully, I picked a quiet way to Helvellyn. It meant that I had much of the place to myself, though others very occasionally passed me. Naturally, there was an ascent too, and I noticed a certain lack of strength in my legs. Because the outing was part of a weekend away, I brought a heavier rucksack with me, the one that I used to use all the time before the pandemic came our way. Since the difference between that and the Lowe Alpine that I acquired in 2020 was easily perceptible, the effect on my legs was attributed to that. Taking things steady was the only option available.</p><p>Others could be seen on a track on the other side of the valley, highlighting that numerous route options are available. Because Striding Edge and Swirral Edge, well known though they are, seemed too airy to me, I opted for a gentler route. They may have been busy too, not the best when there is not so much space for everyone. Instead, I was bound for Whiteside Bank, from which the way to Helvellyn would take me over Lower Man. A longer option might have been to go via Stick&#8217;s Pass and include Raise on the way; eschewing Helvellyn altogether, that might have opened up a myriad of routes leading north. One thing is certain: there is no shortage of hiking possibilities in these parts.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13826" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4527_sharpened.jpg" alt="Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4527_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4527_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4527_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13826" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4527_sharpened.jpg" alt="Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4527_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4527_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4527_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13827" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4571_sharpened.jpg" alt="Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4571_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4571_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4571_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13827" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4571_sharpened.jpg" alt="Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4571_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4571_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4571_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>The skies might have been full of dispersed clouds, yet they still obstructed the sun from time to time. A few of episodes cam my way while I was ascending the flank of Glenridding Common and around Whiteside Bank, and there was less luck with sunshine for anyone around Catstye Cam. Looking back towards Patterdale drew my eyes to what lay behind me and how far I had come. The lack of rapidity was no concern of mine, given the delights through which I passed. After all, shortcuts can take longer, especially when there is significant height gain involved.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full

pervading thought struck me: the views from a lofty vantage point can save much traipsing along the ground. When you have distant Skiddaw and Blencathra in your sights, as well as nearby Ullswater and Thirlmere, that point is rather rammed home for you. Throw in a sighting of Bassenthwaite Lake and the suggestion becomes incontestable. It is little wonder that Helvellyn draws so many, some of them from the Grasmere side of the fell.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13832" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4605_sharpened.jpg" alt="Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4605_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4605_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4605_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13832" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4605_sharpened.jpg" alt="Hiking lofty Helvellyn: A commendable scenic detour on the way to Scotland" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4605_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4605_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4605_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>Though this might be rugged countryside, Helvellyn&#8217;s summit was a busy place when I was there that day.

The routing felt indirect around Highpark Wood; it was a case of having come far yet having further to go. Once down on the A591 beneath Highpark Wood, the next move was to locate a bus stop to await the next service to Keswick. Thirlspot was in my mind, though it was not necessary to even go that far, which was just as well after the descent. While the terrain may have been more level, any rest was appreciated, and I marvelled at what I managed to get down while looking back on the route.</p><p>The bus to Keswick came soon enough, which felt just as well given that I was near a car park that was located away from so much. Even so, there are numerous trails around there would be more suitable for some of those trying to go up my descent route. My time in Keswick was brief, since I fancied getting going back to Carlisle as soon as I could. Cancellations of train services lay on my mind a bit, and they affected my eventual departure from Penrith so much that I wondered at my haste to get there. It felt like a ghost town after the busier spots in the Lake District, especially when so much natural glory had been my lot that day.</p><h4>Travel Arrangements</h4><p>Bus service 508 got me from Penrith to Glenridding after a train journey from Carlisle. The train journey to the latter featured changes at Manchester and Wigan. Bus service 555 got me to Keswick from the end of my hike, while bus service X4 or X5 got me from there to Penrith for a train back to Carlisle. The next day, train travel conveyed me from Carlisle to Stirling, with a change in Edinburgh. The rest of that story is elsewhere on here.</p></div><div class="post mb-5"><h2 class="mb-4"><a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/added-springtime-serendipity-around-stirling-and-the-trossachs-from-forthside-to-lochside/">Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside</a></h2> <small class="mb-1">14<sup>th</sup> January 2025</small> <small class="mb-4"></small><p>To complete, the Stirling series of trip reports, I am leaping forward to April 2024 to relate the rest of the excursion to Stirling that closed out my rambling around Ben Ledi. That portion of the trip has been described already as part of <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/tales-of-patient-persistence-ascents-of-ben-ledi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the collection of hikes around Callander&#8217;s main local hill</a>. That was not the only highlight offered by a few days of sunshine that contrasted with previous dull weather stints in the area.</p><h4>Footsteps Around the Forth</h4><p>Stirling is not always a dull weather spot for me, though. While my first encounter with the place in 2002 might have gone like that, others have not been so. Typically, they have been weekend affairs, with a Saturday arrival and a Sunday departure. There are a few that stand out in my memory. One from November 2023 is among these with its incursion into the Ochil Hills on a gravel track shod with lighter footwear, not my usual way of working. That too has been described elsewhere as one of <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/from-distant-viewings-to-up-close-encounters-and-incursions-autumnal-traipsing-in-the-ochil-hills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a collection of hikes around the said hills</a>. There has been some slicing of hill walking trips to the area, of which this is another example.</p><p>Returning to Stirling walks, one from February 2016 remains lodged in my mind, coming as it did in a period of great change for me. The Sunday of that weekend came as a crisp, chilly, sunny day that I could not waste. Going inside to see what is in Stirling Castle or the Wallace Monument did not feel right to me, so I stayed out of both of them. When there is a significant fee, there often is a commitment that I am not willing to make.</p><p>My traipsing then took me around Gowanhill, the caste perimeter and Old Stirling before I wandered in the direction of Cambuskenneth Abbey, or what remains of it, which sadly is not that much. Then, I pottered around the Wallace Monument before circling around to Old Stirling Bridge. All this occupied enough of the day beside part of the River Forth that I had no inclination to approach the Ochil Hills, which I was then viewing from further afield.</p><p>Stirling&#8217;s Castle has its photographic attractiveness, and that brings me to May 2019 when I arrived in the city to make use of some evening lighting. Otherwise, it was a case of retracing old steps before returning south after the last of a string of Scottish incursions, mainly centred on Edinburgh and starting around Easter of the year. For later visits, the motivation was photographic, while the Easter escapade featured much walking and slaying of old wounding memories from my time living in the city for educational advancement.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13810" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13810" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13811" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13811" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13812" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13812" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>The first evening of my stay in April 2024 drew on those previous visits to Stirling. Wandering by the River Forth took me by the Cambuskenneth Abbey ruin. After a photographic vigil, I set on for the Wallace Monument while more photographic exertions resulted before I started to explore the trails around Abbey Craig. Since the monument was shut for the day, there were few about to intrude on any solitary ambling. There was much to savour in this compact area before I again struck on for Old Stirling Bridge and followed the River Forth as far as Forth Valley College before turning towards the castle while the day wore on towards sunset. The light was faded, so photography was near halted, or at least the results got regarded as mere record shots. Going around by King&#8217;s Knot, I made my way towards the lodgings for my stay, noting in the west where I was headed the following morning.</p><h4>Lochside Rambling from Callander to Aberfoyle</h4><p>It is often that an outing inspires a follow-up excursion. It was during the hike around Ben Ledi that I spotted an information board mentioning the prospect of circumnavigating Loch Vennacher among other possibilities. Naturally, that popped an idea into my head. With the Ochil Hills being closed off by an incursion in November 2023, that left a day free to make use of the idea. It all was in the spirit of serendipity, and that was set to affect the execution as well.</p><p>Thus, I returned to Callander after the gifts of the previous day. Hovering over the day was a throwback to the English August Bank Holiday weekend in 2007 when I ventured north to Scotland to hike <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/trekking-around-the-trossachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of the Rob Roy Way from Drymen to Callander with a stopover in Aberfoyle</a>. A tumble in a train station rather cast a shadow over the proceedings because of my having hurt my ribs at the time. That made the use of a rucksack more challenging, especially since I was carrying quite a load for the weekend. Nevertheless, I managed to follow through on my plans with an overcast arrival in Callander after a sun blessed start in Aberfoyle. Even so, there were many thoughts about coming back to the area that were lost to me until I revisited that old trip report, even giving a little re-editing for clarity.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13813" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13813" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13814" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13814" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>Thus, when I followed the A81 across the River Teith after a circuitous deviation caused by my stocking up on refreshments, I probably was reversing a route taken nearly seventeen years before, albeit in continuous bright spring sunshine. It was as if I were using an idea parked in my writings for years before. Once off that A road, which can be busy, I was on quieter tarmac. Since this also is part of National Cycle Network route 7, I also had cyclists for company, even leap frogging a duo until they got going and left me after them. Heavier traffic like timber lorries can go this way, so care is needed, and there was one that passed me at one point. Mostly, though, I was in quiet surroundings.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13815"

conveyed me to the shore of Loch Vennachar, which I had viewed from around Ben Ledi the day before. Some wild swimmers were in the water, and I left them to their pursuit, surveying what lay north of me. Naturally, one of the hummocks was Ben Ledi and its neighbouring hills. One of these, Stuc Odhar, even appeared its equal in a distance of some kilometres; in reality, the summit heights differ by over two hundred metres. Nevertheless, these were to detain my attention for much of the way.</p><p>All the while, there were constant reminders that Aberfoyle is not that far away; Scottish Rights of Way Society signage offered evidence of that, tempting me to reprise the former route from August 2007, albeit in reverse. Even so, I stuck with the cycling route because that hugged the loch shore. After an awkward meeting with others near the Sailing Club premises around East Lodge, I continued past West Dullater with a brief stop at the Invertrossachs Scout Activity Centre, where I was reminded of days spent at the Firbush Field Centre during my university days in Edinburgh.</p><p>Around Invertrossachs, I left the roadway for a narrower track that still acted as a cycle path, forming part of NCN 7. It amazed me that the trail was in use by bicycle tourers, given the lack of width. Thankfully, it was quiet and a pleasure to stroll, with only one cyclist passing the way. While the bucolic woodland may have limited views, they had been somewhat unchanging anyway.</p><p>That had altered by the time that forest cover began to thin to allow views of the western extent of Loch Venachar, which was petering out, unlike its eastern end, which is dammed. All this may have started below the dam of Loch Drunkie, which I would meet later; at that stage, it was hidden among the trees around a kilometre away to my left. My surroundings began to feel more peopled as I approached the track junction where there was a sign for Aberfoyle, one of several that I had passed that day.</p><p>A desire for ice cream lured me onto the route of the Three Lochs Drive to find the way to Brig o&#8217; Turk. If I had stuck with my initial plan, the Great Trossachs Path would be carrying me back to Callander. Instead, I had decided to make for Aberfoyle, conscious that its last bus to Stirling was earlier in the day than that from Callander. Nevertheless, I continued to Brig o&#8217; Turk on what became a fool&#8217;s errand, for there is nary a service station in the place. However, I did get to spot the way to Glen Finglas, somewhere that tickles my fancy for another time.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13821" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13821" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>On the way back from Brig o&#8217; Turk, I took a chance and went as far as Loch Achray before circling back to the junction where I left the NCN 7. Time was on my mind at this point because the twists and turns of the trail to Aberfoyle made for difficult ready reckoning of progress. Even with the noticeable strength of the sun and the heat of the afternoon, I pressed on uphill.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13822" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13822" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>In time, I would meet with Loch Drunkie and stop for photographic exertions on a periodic basis. The Forest Drive was being well-used by then, not necessarily the most relaxing situation for a passing hiker, though it was to have a compensation later. Many were stopped by the loch, which hardly was a surprise in the circumstances. Once past this sprawling watery landmark, the heat experienced on broad forestry tracks was punctuated by a random act of kindness: a Tunnock&#8217;s Tea Cake was offered through a car window, and it would have been rude to refuse it. Profuse gratitude after acceptance could be the only response.</p><p>Near an unseen Lochan Reòidhte, the Forest Drive route was left behind me as the trail entered shadier surroundings, another blessed relief from the weather. While warm sunshine is great and is sought, there can be a cost for a journeying rambler; using sunscreen is a must (especially for fair skinned types like me), as is keeping hydrated. A descent laden with progress lay ahead of me, yet my thoughts turned to anyone coming the other way on this steep track. It was becoming clear that my timing worries were for nought; there was plenty of time in the end.</p><p>Once the gradients slackened, aching limbs needed coaxing to continue the rest of the way. Thankfully, the end was in sight by then, and refreshment supplies were augmented ahead of a replenishment break before the bus appeared. That left me about an hour in Aberfoyle, a very quiet place, while I was there. Protesting knees got some respite as information boards were surveyed. Not without reason has Aberfoyle been highlighted as a centre for mountain biking, with all the tracks and trails that thread the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park. The moniker &#8220;<a href="https://www.gravelfoyle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gravelfoyle</a>&#8221; has been invented to reflect this, for there is much here, though some steep slopes can be expected. To one weary wanderer, all that felt far away, so the arrival of the last bus to Stirling was a welcome sight.</p><p>Looking through photos now, I realise that I pottered around Stirling again before retiring for the night. There should have been continuing fatigue after the day&#8217;s exertions, yet the sunny evening drew me outside again, though not for an extensive stroll like the first evening in the city. The next morning, sunny surroundings may have attempted to hold on to me only for life&#8217;s responsibilities to ensure that I returned south again. Nonetheless, there remained an air of satisfaction as I did so. Scottish sunshine had done its magic and its landscapes gleamed as a result.</p><h4>Prospects and Reflections</h4><p>Though I might be less inclined to focus my attention on Aberfoyle, I am left with some ideas for possible future visits to these parts. Hiking the northern side of Loch Venachar is one option with a few added extensions. Glen Finglas is the first of these that could be part of a larger circuit around Ben Ledi. After that, there is Loch Katrine, which lay some kilometres west of where I found myself, and time was against my reaching its shores. A lengthy out and back trot from Callander would fit in that one during longer daylight hours. Sometimes, adding to one&#8217;s ideas collection can prompt a fear that one will remain ever distracted by them and unable to attend to the essential matters of life. Even so, it is even worse not to have any at all.</p></div><div class="bpaging"> <a class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none stretch mb-3" rel="nofollow"
