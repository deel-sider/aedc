That portion of the trip has been described already as part of <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/tales-of-patient-persistence-ascents-of-ben-ledi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the collection of hikes around Callander&#8217;s main local hill</a>. That was not the only highlight offered by a few days of sunshine that contrasted with previous dull weather stints in the area.</p><h4>Footsteps Around the Forth</h4><p>Stirling is not always a dull weather spot for me, though. While my first encounter with the place in 2002 might have gone like that, others have not been so. Typically, they have been weekend affairs, with a Saturday arrival and a Sunday departure. There are a few that stand out in my memory. One from November 2023 is among these with its incursion into the Ochil Hills on a gravel track shod with lighter footwear, not my usual way of working. That too has been described elsewhere as one of <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/from-distant-viewings-to-up-close-encounters-and-incursions-autumnal-traipsing-in-the-ochil-hills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a collection of hikes around the said hills</a>. There has been some slicing of hill walking trips to the area, of which this is another example.</p><p>Returning to Stirling walks, one from February 2016 remains lodged in my mind, coming as it did in a period of great change for me. The Sunday of that weekend came as a crisp, chilly, sunny day that I could not waste. Going inside to see what is in Stirling Castle or the Wallace Monument did not feel right to me, so I stayed out of both of them. When there is a significant fee, there often is a commitment that I am not willing to make.</p><p>My traipsing then took me around Gowanhill, the caste perimeter and Old Stirling before I wandered in the direction of Cambuskenneth Abbey, or what remains of it, which sadly is not that much. Then, I pottered around the Wallace Monument before circling around to Old Stirling Bridge. All this occupied enough of the day beside part of the River Forth that I had no inclination to approach the Ochil Hills, which I was then viewing from further afield.</p><p>Stirling&#8217;s Castle has its photographic attractiveness, and that brings me to May 2019 when I arrived in the city to make use of some evening lighting. Otherwise, it was a case of retracing old steps before returning south after the last of a string of Scottish incursions, mainly centred on Edinburgh and starting around Easter of the year. For later visits, the motivation was photographic, while the Easter escapade featured much walking and slaying of old wounding memories from my time living in the city for educational advancement.</p><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13810" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13810" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1639_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p><img decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13811" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13811" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1648_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p><img decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13812" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13812" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1674_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>The first evening of my stay in April 2024 drew on those previous visits to Stirling. Wandering by the River Forth took me by the Cambuskenneth Abbey ruin. After a photographic vigil, I set on for the Wallace Monument while more photographic exertions resulted before I started to explore the trails around Abbey Craig. Since the monument was shut for the day, there were few about to intrude on any solitary ambling. There was much to savour in this compact area before I again struck on for Old Stirling Bridge and followed the River Forth as far as Forth Valley College before turning towards the castle while the day wore on towards sunset. The light was faded, so photography was near halted, or at least the results got regarded as mere record shots. Going around by King&#8217;s Knot, I made my way towards the lodgings for my stay, noting in the west where I was headed the following morning.</p><h4>Lochside Rambling from Callander to Aberfoyle</h4><p>It is often that an outing inspires a follow-up excursion. It was during the hike around Ben Ledi that I spotted an information board mentioning the prospect of circumnavigating Loch Vennacher among other possibilities. Naturally, that popped an idea into my head. With the Ochil Hills being closed off by an incursion in November 2023, that left a day free to make use of the idea. It all was in the spirit of serendipity, and that was set to affect the execution as well.</p><p>Thus, I returned to Callander after the gifts of the previous day. Hovering over the day was a throwback to the English August Bank Holiday weekend in 2007 when I ventured north to Scotland to hike <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/trekking-around-the-trossachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of the Rob Roy Way from Drymen to Callander with a stopover in Aberfoyle</a>. A tumble in a train station rather cast a shadow over the proceedings because of my having hurt my ribs at the time. That made the use of a rucksack more challenging, especially since I was carrying quite a load for the weekend. Nevertheless, I managed to follow through on my plans with an overcast arrival in Callander after a sun blessed start in Aberfoyle. Even so, there were many thoughts about coming back to the area that were lost to me until I revisited that old trip report, even giving a little re-editing for clarity.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13813" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13813" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1954_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13814" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13814" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP1962_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>Thus, when I followed the A81 across the River Teith after a circuitous deviation caused by my stocking up on refreshments, I probably was reversing a route taken nearly seventeen years before, albeit in continuous bright spring sunshine. It was as if I were using an idea parked in my writings for years before. Once off that A road, which can be busy, I was on quieter tarmac. Since this also is part of National Cycle Network route 7, I also had cyclists for company, even leap frogging a duo until they got going and left me after them. Heavier traffic like timber lorries can go this way, so care is needed, and there was one that passed me at one point. Mostly, though, I was in quiet surroundings.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13815"

conveyed me to the shore of Loch Vennachar, which I had viewed from around Ben Ledi the day before. Some wild swimmers were in the water, and I left them to their pursuit, surveying what lay north of me. Naturally, one of the hummocks was Ben Ledi and its neighbouring hills. One of these, Stuc Odhar, even appeared its equal in a distance of some kilometres; in reality, the summit heights differ by over two hundred metres. Nevertheless, these were to detain my attention for much of the way.</p><p>All the while, there were constant reminders that Aberfoyle is not that far away; Scottish Rights of Way Society signage offered evidence of that, tempting me to reprise the former route from August 2007, albeit in reverse. Even so, I stuck with the cycling route because that hugged the loch shore. After an awkward meeting with others near the Sailing Club premises around East Lodge, I continued past West Dullater with a brief stop at the Invertrossachs Scout Activity Centre, where I was reminded of days spent at the Firbush Field Centre during my university days in Edinburgh.</p><p>Around Invertrossachs, I left the roadway for a narrower track that still acted as a cycle path, forming part of NCN 7. It amazed me that the trail was in use by bicycle tourers, given the lack of width. Thankfully, it was quiet and a pleasure to stroll, with only one cyclist passing the way. While the bucolic woodland may have limited views, they had been somewhat unchanging anyway.</p><p>That had altered by the time that forest cover began to thin to allow views of the western extent of Loch Venachar, which was petering out, unlike its eastern end, which is dammed. All this may have started below the dam of Loch Drunkie, which I would meet later; at that stage, it was hidden among the trees around a kilometre away to my left. My surroundings began to feel more peopled as I approached the track junction where there was a sign for Aberfoyle, one of several that I had passed that day.</p><p>A desire for ice cream lured me onto the route of the Three Lochs Drive to find the way to Brig o&#8217; Turk. If I had stuck with my initial plan, the Great Trossachs Path would be carrying me back to Callander. Instead, I had decided to make for Aberfoyle, conscious that its last bus to Stirling was earlier in the day than that from Callander. Nevertheless, I continued to Brig o&#8217; Turk on what became a fool&#8217;s errand, for there is nary a service station in the place. However, I did get to spot the way to Glen Finglas, somewhere that tickles my fancy for another time.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13821" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13821" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2054_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>On the way back from Brig o&#8217; Turk, I took a chance and went as far as Loch Achray before circling back to the junction where I left the NCN 7. Time was on my mind at this point because the twists and turns of the trail to Aberfoyle made for difficult ready reckoning of progress. Even with the noticeable strength of the sun and the heat of the afternoon, I pressed on uphill.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13822" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13822" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened.jpg" alt="Added springtime serendipity around Stirling and the Trossachs: From Forthside to lochside" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP2095_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>In time, I would meet with Loch Drunkie and stop for photographic exertions on a periodic basis. The Forest Drive was being well-used by then, not necessarily the most relaxing situation for a passing hiker, though it was to have a compensation later. Many were stopped by the loch, which hardly was a surprise in the circumstances. Once past this sprawling watery landmark, the heat experienced on broad forestry tracks was punctuated by a random act of kindness: a Tunnock&#8217;s Tea Cake was offered through a car window, and it would have been rude to refuse it. Profuse gratitude after acceptance could be the only response.</p><p>Near an unseen Lochan Reòidhte, the Forest Drive route was left behind me as the trail entered shadier surroundings, another blessed relief from the weather. While warm sunshine is great and is sought, there can be a cost for a journeying rambler; using sunscreen is a must (especially for fair skinned types like me), as is keeping hydrated. A descent laden with progress lay ahead of me, yet my thoughts turned to anyone coming the other way on this steep track. It was becoming clear that my timing worries were for nought; there was plenty of time in the end.</p><p>Once the gradients slackened, aching limbs needed coaxing to continue the rest of the way. Thankfully, the end was in sight by then, and refreshment supplies were augmented ahead of a replenishment break before the bus appeared. That left me about an hour in Aberfoyle, a very quiet place, while I was there. Protesting knees got some respite as information boards were surveyed. Not without reason has Aberfoyle been highlighted as a centre for mountain biking, with all the tracks and trails that thread the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park. The moniker &#8220;<a href="https://www.gravelfoyle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gravelfoyle</a>&#8221; has been invented to reflect this, for there is much here, though some steep slopes can be expected. To one weary wanderer, all that felt far away, so the arrival of the last bus to Stirling was a welcome sight.</p><p>Looking through photos now, I realise that I pottered around Stirling again before retiring for the night. There should have been continuing fatigue after the day&#8217;s exertions, yet the sunny evening drew me outside again, though not for an extensive stroll like the first evening in the city. The next morning, sunny surroundings may have attempted to hold on to me only for life&#8217;s responsibilities to ensure that I returned south again. Nonetheless, there remained an air of satisfaction as I did so. Scottish sunshine had done its magic and its landscapes gleamed as a result.</p><h4>Prospects and Reflections</h4><p>Though I might be less inclined to focus my attention on Aberfoyle, I am left with some ideas for possible future visits to these parts. Hiking the northern side of Loch Venachar is one option with a few added extensions. Glen Finglas is the first of these that could be part of a larger circuit around Ben Ledi. After that, there is Loch Katrine, which lay some kilometres west of where I found myself, and time was against my reaching its shores. A lengthy out and back trot from Callander would fit in that one during longer daylight hours. Sometimes, adding to one&#8217;s ideas collection can prompt a fear that one will remain ever distracted by them and unable to attend to the essential matters of life. Even so, it is even worse not to have any at all.</p></div><div class="post mb-5"><h2 class="mb-4"><a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/from-distant-viewings-to-up-close-encounters-and-incursions-autumnal-traipsing-in-the-ochil-hills/">From distant viewings to up-close encounters and incursions: autumnal traipsing in the Ochil Hills</a></h2> <small class="mb-1">12<sup>th</sup> January 2025</small> <small class="mb-4"></small><p>It was a series of weekend visits to Stirling that drew my eyes towards the Ochil Hills to the east of the city. My first recollection of that happenstance takes me make to February 2016, in a period when other life activities sapped energy for exploring the outdoors. Just finding a hotel for a night and wandering around the historic citadel was enough for me. There were other visits, like a photography inspired one in May 2019, part of a run of Scottish incursions that year. The pandemic confined me to local wanderings, yet the possibility of a Scottish one based in Stirling never left my head.</p><p>When Scottish hill country outings came to mind, the lures lay further north and further west. It was too easy to pass Stirling en route to elsewhere. Eventually, thoughts turned to using the place as a springboard for exploring less familiar parts. Overlooked though they might be by many, that meant the Ochil Hills; they inspired a first trip to Scotland late in August 2022. While heading up there, the idea of Ben Ledi also popped into my mind, dividing my loyalties in the process.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/tales-of-patient-persistence-ascents-of-ben-ledi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Ledi forays</a> get described elsewhere, while this report collates those centring on the real inspiration for the August bank holiday weekend excursion. There was a return several weeks later in September, around the time of the Royal funeral for Queen Elizabeth. That was to attend to some loose ends from the first traverse when a soaking was my lot. Though there was an added consolation at the end of August before I headed south again, it took until November 2023 for some photographic closure to be reached.</p><h4>A Tillicoultry Circuit That Got Me a Soaking</h4><p>If the weather that I had enjoyed during the ascent of Helvellyn on the last Saturday of August 2022 had continued, there would have been no dilemma posed by my dreaming up an ascent of Ben Ledi to complement an incursion into the Ochil Hills. However, the run of Scottish weather did not make life that easy, even if it looked promising when I got to Stirling on the Sunday of the same weekend when I hiked up and down Helvellyn.</p><p>Based on the height of Ben Ledi, I decided to visit that on the bank holiday Monday when I had a guarantee of clear summits. The bank holiday was English and not Scottish, which made public transport work better for me around Stirling than it would have done around Macclesfield. The decision meant that I left the lower tops of the Ochil Hills for a day when summit visibility was not a foregone conclusion. There was a price to be paid for that.</p><p>There is an enduring memory of dark dreich mornings during this August sojourn. Even so, that must not have been the whole story, for I got some brightness to start my Ben Ledi foray and a brief incursion into the Ochil Hills in bright sunshine before my journey south. Two mornings would have brightened on that evidence.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13767" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4789_sharpened.jpg" alt="From distant viewings to up-close encounters and incursions: autumnal traipsing in the Ochil Hills" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4789_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4789_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4789_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13767" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4789_sharpened.jpg" alt="From distant viewings to up-close encounters and incursions: autumnal traipsing in the Ochil Hills" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4789_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4789_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4789_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>The problem then was the morning of my first Ochil Hills traverse. However, the air remained drier at lower levels; the problem was when enough height was gained. There was another hitch: the initial plan had been to ascend Ben Cleuch from Tillicoultry and then proceed east from there. Though there was a warning about a collapsed section of path in Mill Glen, I decided to see if the difficulty could be surmounted. When I found that was not a possibility, I more or less retraced my steps to go west towards and through Ochil Hills Woodland Park. There would be no ascent of The Law, not that it bothered me that much.</p><p>From there, I went across Silver Glen to pick up the track leading past The Gowls and The Nebit. If I had wanted an escape route, the way to Alva was signed, but my mind was decided by then. In time, I left the main track to ascend Ben Ever and go into the clag that would soak me until the descent towards Dollar. While visibility was reduced, making use of navigational handrails like fences kept me from going astray. At least, I could not see anything of the wind turbines that were near at hand.</p><p>From Ben Ever, I made my way to the summit of Ben Cleuch, the highest top in the Ochil Hills. Given the restrictions on visibility, any descent to Tillicoultry via The Law would not appeal to me; it felt too risky to me in the circumstances. Avoiding that original planned ascent of The Law, found in a guidebook, might have made me use slopes that were less punishing, never a bad thing. In a similar vein, manageable undulations were my lot as I continued from Ben Ever to Ben Cleuch and then to Andrew Gannel Hill. The name of the latter may suggest that it was named after a real person, yet it is more likely a corruption of an earlier Gaelic name.</p><p>After Andrew Gannel Hill, the subsequent descent and ascent needed to reach King&#8217;s Seat Hill was more noticeable, and peering along the glen leading back to Tillicoultry made me wonder what delights could be savoured if the weather so allowed. This could have been another escape route if I had wanted it too. With a certain determination, I crossed the last major summit of the day before beginning my descent to Dollar.</p><p>That dropped me out of the damp cloud to allow my gear to dry a little. The views were clearer too, though there remained a pervading general greyness. Now that I think of it, I had the hills to myself, which was more of a bonus than a consolation. Maybe there are times when dreich and off-putting weather has its upsides.</p><p>My descent route took me past Kames and the Banks of Dollar before crossing the top of Bank Hill to commence the final descent into Dollar Glen. The ruin of Castle Campbell lay below me as I continued downhill. Once on the floor of the glen, I may have tarried a while for some refreshments before continuing; lunching on the tops was out of the question. Students of the Dollar Academy, one of Scotland’s independent schools and an alma mater of Hamish Brown, well known for a first continuous self-powered round of Scotland&#8217;s Munros, were out and about. That did nothing to stop me acquiring more refreshments, for my journey was not over yet.</p><p>Dollar had lost the regular bus service that it had before the pandemic, so I needed to reach Tillicoultry for the nearest stop with a regular service. This feels a bit odd since the southern side of the Ochil Hills is bedecked with places that are not far from each other. In any event, I made for the combined Devon Way and National Cycle Network route 767 that ran along the trackbed of a dismantled railway. Shadowing the River Devon, I shortened the journey to Tillicoultry while glimpsing as much as I could see of the nearby hills, among which I had spent much of the day. This last portion did not take that long to complete, so I could catch the bus to Stirling and dry out even more after my wetting.</p><h4>Much Drier, Albeit with Limited Sunshine</h4><p>The combination of a feeling of unfinished business and the instatement of an extra bank holiday due to a royal funeral, that of Queen Elizabeth, meant that I had a chance to go north again. After travelling on the Saturday of that weekend, Sunday was available for what became a walk from Alva to Dollar and Tillicoultry that diverted through the Ochil Hills. There may have been some breaks in the cloud, yet conditions remained largely overcast, not that it troubles me as I write these words.</p><p>From Alva, I made for Alva Glen before climbing out of there to approach Silver Glen. My route instead shadowed the glen as I reprised the way that I went a few weeks before. Passing The Gowls and The Nebit, I did not continue to Ben Ever, but instead kept going until the track petered out near Ben Buck. As I kept looking back, I marvelled at what lay behind me and wondered how the landscape would appear if the skies had been more cooperative.</p><p>Once on Ben Buck, I realised how close the wind turbines were. Though we have an ongoing climate crisis, these fixtures are controversial in any landscape, and the Ochil Hills are no different. Not being a fan of such industrialisation, they intruded on how I previsualise my preferred photographic results to be. Once something is in place though, we just have to bear with me, and I kept walking according to my plan.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13755" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4984_sharpened.jpg" alt="From distant viewings to up-close encounters and incursions: autumnal traipsing in the Ochil Hills" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4984_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4984_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4984_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13755" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4984_sharpened.jpg" alt="From distant viewings to up-close encounters and incursions: autumnal traipsing in the Ochil Hills" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4984_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4984_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP4984_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>An undulating course took me across Ben Cleuch and Andrew Gannel Hill. To the north of where I was wandering, I could glimpse sunlit hills, perhaps wishing for a swap or a bit more inclusion from those breaks in the cloud cover. It needed patience, but some magic began to happen when I was around King&#8217;s Seat Hill. It started when I was still ascending after the hefty height loss on the way down off Andrew Gannel Hill. Would it deny me while I was labouring uphill?</p><p>Thankfully, it did not. In fact, it gave me time to be in position for the desired lighting and made me wait for it, too. Thus, I dawdled on a photographic vigil that yielded some passing success. When the show ended, I began to make for Dollar again. While the route was similar to that of weeks before, my mood differed after the light show I had been gifted. The day of the week allowed more to be around the town while I continued on my way to Tillicoultry, going the same way as before.</p><h4>Consolations and Resolutions</h4><p>This part of the account is going to hop and jump in time. The overarching connection is autumnal sunshine, though in different years and circumstances. It illustrates the strange ways in which closure can be reached. A certain sense of being underequipped is associated with this portion of the compendium of accounts.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13758" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1038_sharpened.jpg" alt="From distant viewings to up-close encounters and incursions: autumnal traipsing in the Ochil Hills" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1038_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1038_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1038_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13758" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1038_sharpened.jpg" alt="From distant viewings to up-close encounters and incursions: autumnal traipsing in the Ochil Hills" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1038_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1038_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1038_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>Firstly, we head back to the last morning of the first trip at the end of August. Inadvertently, I left my Pentax DSLR on overnight and the battery was exhausted. Thus, I resorted to a Canon RP instead, even if that was not as well-endowed with battery capacity and also was not fully charged; some recharging was attempted when morning sunshine was noted. Thus, I headed to Alva while shod in Merrell trail shoes. They did the needful as I climbed out of Alva Glen on the way towards The Gowls, and sufficed for the descent too.</p><p>Numerous photos were made before the Canon&#8217;s battery ailed, meaning that I needed to use my phone to capture what other delights were on offer. Time was at a premium, too, since I needed to check out of my hotel and travel south. Even so, I was not denied, as the above photo should show you; that was made with the Canon, too. The experience likely encouraged me to return to Stirling a few weeks later.</p><p>The same trail shoes, albeit older and showing their age a bit, facilitated another incursion into the Ochil Hills, this time in November. Having halted in Edinburgh a little that day before, mainly for seeing what I could do with eastward views from Corstorphine Hill.

After that, I caught a bus thinking that I was going to Alva. However, I blundered and was on the bus to Alloa via Tullibody instead. It might have been my Irish accent, but the driver should have told me when I said Alva. Realising my mistake, I made do with starting from Alloa for Tillicoultry on a wonderful morning. This was no hardship and placed no restrictions on my rambling on a November day with shorter hours of daylight.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-13796" src="//www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP0548_sharpened.jpg" alt="From distant viewings to up-close encounters and incursions: autumnal traipsing in the Ochil Hills" width="770" height="545" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP0548_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP0548_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP0548_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13796" src="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP0548_sharpened.jpg" alt="From distant viewings to up-close encounters and incursions: autumnal traipsing in the Ochil Hills" width="770" height="545" srcset="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP0548_sharpened.jpg 770w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP0548_sharpened-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMGP0548_sharpened-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></noscript></p><p>This time, the Devon Way and NCN 767 combination would get me to Tillicoultry from Alloa, expanding the extent of the route that I have followed over the course of time.

the track in earnest, the human encounters declined to nothing, and I could savour the scenic delights in the wonderful afternoon sunshine. The experience showed me what was missing on that second time in the area. At the end of the track, I just turned back. It felt adventurous having even got that far; the top of Ben Buck may have been near, but I prefer to use boots for off track travel like that. Shadows were lengthening, too, reminding me that getting to Alva was pressing. Thus, I set to doing just that and retracing steps from before for that descent. The gradients made me wary until I got to Alva Glen, especially around The Gowls and even when nearing the glen itself. Confidence in one&#8217;s footwear makes a big difference.</p><p>Once on Alva&#8217;s main thoroughfare, I set to awaiting the next bus to Stirling, keenly aware that I might have been cutting things fine for the rail journey home, especially for getting beyond Stockport to Macclesfield; trains stop running earlier on a Sunday. There must have been no issue in the end because that surely would reside in my memory. The trail shoes would be partially retired after I noticed stitching giving way on one of them while on a trip to Limerick a few weeks later. Over the course of three years, they had acquitted themselves well enough to encourage me to get a new pair anyway.</p><h4>Reflections</h4><p>One thing that has not been mentioned in these accounts is what inspired me to go following the trails that I did. The short answer is that a Cicerone guidebook had its part to play. In some ways, I ended up assembling routes from portions of what it described while combining others. As ever, there is more to explore, even if that needs more commitment than using the local bus service 52 (it was service 51 that I inadvertently used in 2023). So much has been savoured so far that other designs can wait while other places get their time too.</p></div><div class="post mb-5"><h2 class="mb-4"><a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/sometimes-it-is-difficult-to-pick-the-pictures/">Sometimes, it is difficult to pick the pictures</a></h2> <small class="mb-1">22<sup>nd</sup> December 2024</small> <small class="mb-4"></small><p>There is something that has come home to me while writing recent trip reports. The biggest has not been extricating sufficient details from my memory, though that can be a problem at times. It is picking the accompanying photos from the collection that has accumulated. This especially is an issue when I am away for a few days, like my trips to Ireland throughout 2022 and 2023.</p><p>What happens is that I come away with so many of them. Though photography should be more deliberate, the desire to come away with at least a few that work means that I often cannot help myself. This can intrude on being completely present in a moment if one is not careful, and such is our acquisitiveness that our better reasoning can be overwhelmed when in the midst of natural beauty enhanced by the right kind of light. Emotions often override, and perhaps cloud, our conscious thinking.</p><p>In one way, a collection of photos showing every part of a hike can act as a partial video that prompts our minds to extract details that otherwise would not reappear. It is when there is an insufficient number that jogging the memory becomes less effective. What is novel will persist more than what is commonplace and uneventful, as I have found in recent months. The emotional response and even a painful recollection sends us back to a particular moment. Without these, narratives can be challenging to construct.</p><p>When I started writing these trip reports, they were generally timely, so summon all the details to compile an account was straightforward. Any limitation on the supply of photos was no difficulty, either. Just one or two would brighten an account. Film photography persisted as my main medium perhaps too long, as I have found when reviewing my online photo albums. The associated cost also cut down the number of photos, which helped when editing. Because processing those photos also was slower, I got into digital photography to have some visual accompaniment for the text. Motivations differed in those days.</p><p>Now, I often end up with photos that are so similar in quality that I struggle to work out which one not to use. That can add to the number included with a trip report, and perhaps reflects what has happened with technology. However, there is no need to make things too like video editing. Thus, a rethink is needed. However, those emotions can muddy things on the trail and I land in the same dilemma all the while, even if it is better to have the ability to choose instead of not having anything at all.</p></div><div class="post mb-5"><h2 class="mb-4"><a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/expansion/">Expansion</a></h2> <small class="mb-1">21<sup>st</sup> December 2024</small> <small class="mb-4"></small><p>One activity that I have ongoing at the moment is an expansion of what has been the <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/photos/europe/ireland/cork-city,-castles-coast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cork city album</a> in my <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/photos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online photo gallery</a>. The cause of this is the increase in time around the place since 2022. Then, I spent part of an Irish break based in the city, though, in reality, I was travelling around back then. That took me to nearby Kinsale and Cobh as part of a single day&#8217;s explorations.</p><p>2024 has seen a major upsurge in the amount of time that I spent in the place. Thus, it is now time to include nearby spots like Blarney, Fota, Cobh and Crosshaven. Ballincollig Regional Park could cause that area to get represented, too. Thus far, the scenes do not look so dramatic, but there are more to come, so things could build out from where they are at the time of writing.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/photos/europe/ireland/west-cork/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Cork album</a> is another that could grow after the visits there during the last few years. Each of the main Atlantic peninsulas have seen my footfall this year, and there are reasons to return, like following the Beara Way from Castletownbere as far as Adrigole. The scenery has the drama to draw me back after a muddy, soggy hike from Adrigole to Glengarriff. Staying overnight in the latter when there is a glorious summer evening could be a special experience that cannot be overlooked. Other places like Kinsale or Drimoleague could lure me their way just yet. There are new photos to be added, and more may come for future escapades in the area.</p><p>While the <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/photos/europe/ireland/kerry-countryside-coast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kerry album</a> is large as things stand, there are more vistas to add to it. Repeat visits to Killarney increase the supply, as does explorations of the Dingle Peninsula in May and June 2022. Such is the quality of the county&#8217;s scenery, that it is virtually impossible not to get something from a visit to the place, especially when the weather is on your side.</p><p>The counties of Clare, Tipperary and Waterford could feature in a new and single album. The photos are there, and they show often overlooked gems in the Irish landscape, like what lies around Lough Derg and the Knockmealdown Mountains. All this is a far cry from things were when I began this online enterprise. For a long time, the Irish albums were the poor relation of their Scottish, English and even Welsh counterparts. That appears to be changing, so long as time is found to make the required additions.</p></div><div class="post mb-5"><h2 class="mb-4"><a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/exploring-north-and-mid-wales-through-multiple-seasons/">Exploring north and mid Wales through multiple seasons</a></h2> <small class="mb-1">28<sup>th</sup> August 2024</small> <small class="mb-4"></small><p>This time last year, I was making plenty of visits to Wales. There was a matter in my life that needed attention, and the getaways were a big help with these. Shoehorned within them was a bank holiday weekend foray to Guernsey, but that is not the subject of this piece.</p><p>Looking at my interim synopses of trip reports that await writing, I notice that there have been more in the last few years than I have mentioned above. Even 2020 had one, though there was none in 2021. That got me wondering about a multi-season survey. Though one might have felt wintry, I still believe that it fits in spring. Thus, winter gets excluded here.</p><p>Most were in Eryri National Park, while some featured parts of the Welsh coastline and even the heart of Wales. Wales is of such a size that its coastline is not far away even when hills are being climbed. On weekend stays, most of those places where I overnighted were by the sea as well. Only Chester and Wrexham, which helped with outbound travel during industrial actions on the rail network, were the exceptions. Aberystwyth, Caernarfon, Llandudno and Porthmadog were the coastal bases.</p><p>The list of hills includes Y Garn (near the Ogwen Valley), Glyder Fawr, Glyder Fach, Carnedd Gwenllian, Gyrn Wigau, Cadair Idris, and Pumlumon Fawr. The latter was summited twice, once in damp and dank conditions and the second occasion involved the endurance of chilly, obstinate gusts on what otherwise was a brighter day. Even so, I have my fill of the area for the moment.</p><p>Carnedd Gwenllian also the subject of two approaches, the first was unsuccessful in that it was halted by blustery wet conditions and lack of time. Better weather and more time made it possible to reach that summit; it may have been cloud capped, but there was plenty of sunshine at other times. Gyrn Wigau was crossed on that second trip, on the way back to Bethesda, as it happened. Cadair Idris is best known to me, and I again reached its top, albeit on a hot sunny day. That made for better views than I ever had before, so I descended to Morfa Mawddach instead of Minffordd (my staring point) or Dolgellau.</p><p>Of the Ogwen Valley hills, Y Garn got its own day on a circuit from Nant Peris. The descent proved challenging and prevented me from catching an earlier bus as I might have hoped. Glyder Fach and Glyder Fawr went beforehand and together. Such was the challenge of their terrain that I abandoned designs on reaching Llanberis for a return to the Ogwen Valley. Both days were hot, one in May and the other in July. These were day trips without any overnight stay, unlike others that have been mentioned in this posting.</p><p>The Wales Coast path got well trodden in the middle of all this traipsing. The most recent was the section between Borth and Aberystwyth last March. Sunshine felt like it was being rationed, yet that took nothing away from the walking. The coastal scenery had its own drama anyway. No weather or seasonality can remove that, no matter what.</p><p>Aside from that, it was the North Wales coast that got my attention. Even in 2020, I reached Llandudno for a stroll around the Great Orme, the only coastline exposure that I got during that very challenging year that most probably wish to delete. Last autumn saw two repeat visits, both after hill climbing the day before. On the first of these, I went on top of the headline instead of going around it. For the second, I walked along the coast to Llandudno Junction train station, savouring what I could see with some relish. The first attempt at reaching Carnedd Gwenllian may have been unsuccessful, but the Wales Coast Path got me to Bangor, and with some sunny accompaniment at times too.</p><p>All in all, there was quite a range of weather encountered, from warm sunshine to persistent rain to chilling gusts of wind. Given that, it probably is worth recording which season was which for all of these. For spring, it was the second weekend around Aberystwyth and the day hike around Y Garn. The first of these feet more like winter and the second more like summer. Speaking of the latter, that was when the day circuit of Glyderau happened and when I tried reaching the top of Carnedd Gwenllian, the latter of these followed by coastal walking leading to Bangor and around Llandudno. Again, the first was typical of high summer and the latter giving a hint of approaching autumn, which is when the Irish Celtic seasons would place it. The rest belong to autumn anyway, which remains undeniable, even given the ambiguity there often is about seasonal timings.</p></div><div class="bpaging"> <a class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none
