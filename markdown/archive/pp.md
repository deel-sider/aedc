# Privacy Policy

### Introduction

This is my personal website and it is my policy to respect your privacy regarding any information that may be collected while operating the website.

### Website Visitors

Like so many others, this website collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The purpose of collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use the website.

The website also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on the blog. The website only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the site webmaster.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to the website choose to interact with it in ways that require the gathering of personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that is gathered depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who comment on the blog to provide their name and email address. In each case, the website collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with it. The website does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Statistics may be collected about the behaviour of visitors to the website. However, personally-identifying information never is disclosed other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only is disclosed to the webmaster, any contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on behalf of the website behalf or to provide services available through the website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. The webmaster, any contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information will not be sold to anyone. Other than those described above, the website discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when I believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of the website, third parties or the public at large. The website takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

All information that is sent as configured within your web browser is collected and includes, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type. This information is stored and managed anonymously and independently from your personal details. Also, the information takes the form of statistical data about usersâ€™ browsing actions and patterns and does not identify any individual.

Like many other websites, I use cookies on the AssortedExplorations.com to obtain information about your general Internet usage. A cookie is a small piece of data that your Internet browser stores on your hard drive and is used when you visit the site to tailor your viewing and provide you with customised information. Only the information that you provide, or your preferences while visiting a website, can be stored in a cookie. For example, AssortedExplorations.com cannot determine personal details, such as your email address, unless you choose to submit them.

You are also entitled to ask me to correct, delete or update your personal information, to send your personal information to you or another organisation and to object to automated decision making. Where you have given me your consent to use your personal information in a particular manner, you also have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.

To exercise any of your rights, or if you have any questions relating to your rights, please contact me. If you are unhappy with the way I am using your personal information, you can complain to your local data protection regulator. However, I am here to help and would encourage you to contact me to resolve your complaint first.

### Other Websites

This website contains links to other websites. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they have their own privacy policies and I do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.

### Retention of data

Aggregated, anonymized or pseudonymized information is collected and maintained, which we may retain indefinitely to protect the safety and security of the website, improve its services or comply with legal obligations.
