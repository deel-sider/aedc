### Varied Surroundings

[Explore Surroundings](/surroundings)

Our explorations of the world around us are not dissociated from what goes on around us. That is one of the ideas behind this section and is what is happening to offcuts from the travel section. There are news listings as well as musings over matters that intrude on everyday life and useful tidbits that may have a use in life's wanderings.

This is not just about external surroundings either since what happens inside of us matters too, particularly in response to discomfiting developments. There are times that we gravitate towards comforting writings and it is for that reason that I include off-copyright essays from the likes of Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. That is completed by a few songs and poems that I have collected and some of these were written in appreciation of nature, a subject that can become mystical and transcendental.

Photography is very much about appreciating the natural world too so I have added content collecting what else you can find. Selected practitioners of the art get listed and so do some photography magazines. Seeing how others visually interpret the natural world can help with your efforts. Sometimes, even aping others can enhance the development of your style of presentation.

In summary, this section collects matters intruding on human experiences as well as how we artistically communicate what we experience things in life. That makes for a varied collection yet there is something of a common thread too. This is a newer part of the website than others so there is more evolution in prospect.
