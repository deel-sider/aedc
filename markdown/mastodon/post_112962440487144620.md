Here is a useful map for working out where <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Greenways" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Greenways</a> are in <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Ireland" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Ireland</a>: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1HAHB3jpXV7qgrTHgopH4Zl7-ItDHGEPv&amp;ll=52.839534442296745%2C-7.725919777166398&amp;z=8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no">https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1HAHB3jpXV7qgrTHgopH4Zl7-ItDHGEPv&amp;ll=52.839534442296745%2C-7.725919777166398&amp;z=8</a>. There are different classifications; just use the menu to flick between them. Mind you, some of the potential routes look like those of railway lines that will not be closing any time soon.  Other than that, the effort is impressive. Tailte Ã‰ireann need to do better at marking the completed ones on their maps.
