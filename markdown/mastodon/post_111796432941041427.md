<a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Skiing" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Skiing</a> season is well under way in the <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Canadian" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Canadian</a> Rockies, so Golden Shuttle is offering services between <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Calgary" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Calgary</a> Airport and Golden and between <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Golden" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Golden</a> and Kicking Horse Mountain Resort. Timetables are online too for you to check when buses depart and arrive. If they did something similar during the hiking season, that would be of keen interest to me as a non-driver. <a href="https://www.goldenshuttle.ca/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no">https://www.<span class="">goldenshuttle.ca/</a>
