Saw some contention between users of <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Greenways" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Greenways</a> around <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Cork" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Cork</a> in the last few weeks. The first one definitely was not nice, and the second could have been tricky too. There is a tension between relaxation and exercise that cannot be avoided anywhere. Patience is what is needed, and having more space will help too.
