Last Saturday saw me strolling around <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Edinburgh" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Edinburgh</a>. <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Corstorphine" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Corstorphine</a> LNR got a visit on the way to <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Cramond" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Cramond</a> and <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Silverknowes" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Silverknowes</a>. There was plenty of sunshine along with a seasonal chill. It was great to be out and about.
