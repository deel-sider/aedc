Just found a place to buy Irish <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/maps" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#maps</a> and <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/guidebooks" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#guidebooks</a> that is based in <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Ireland" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Ireland</a>: <a href="https://www.trailheadireland.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no">https://www.<span class="">trailheadireland.com/</a>. This is handy given that ordering from the UK is not what it used to be.
