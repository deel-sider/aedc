Aviemore, again: This recounts a trip to the Scottish Highlands, reflecting on previous visits. These explorations of the Cairngorms included an ascent of Bynack More. Despite a mishap, the scenic beauty, was ravishing, so thoughts led to contemplations of future visits, including cycling and exploring nature reserves. The Highlands, once a refuge, still beckon as a place to experience anew. <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/2023/08/23/aviemore-again/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no">https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/2023/08/23/aviemore-again/</a>
