Was in <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Ireland" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Ireland</a> last week. Did not get very far with what I wanted to do but walked along the <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Limerick" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Limerick</a> Greenway from Newcastle West to <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Rathkeale" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Rathkeale</a>. Also got to see Bunratty castle &amp; Folk Park on a sunnier day. Lots of dry weather too, which helped when going around Limerick city.
