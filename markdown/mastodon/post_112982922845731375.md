A circuit around <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Mangerton" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Mangerton</a> near <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Killarney" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Killarney</a> was far drier than what I found in the Beara peninsula. There is more to savour around there too, though <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Glenflesk" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Glenflesk</a> may make for a better starting point.
