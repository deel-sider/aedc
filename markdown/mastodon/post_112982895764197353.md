Another day trip from <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Cork" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Cork</a> got me to <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Schull" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Schull</a> and <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Ballydehob" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Ballydehob</a>, allowing for some hiking between the two. It is good to get to know where to go walking around West Cork.
