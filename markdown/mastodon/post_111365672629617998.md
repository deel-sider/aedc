Found myself strolling along the East <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Lothian" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Lothian</a> coastline near <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Edinburgh" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Edinburgh</a> in <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Scotland" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Scotland</a> yesterday. There was sunshine, warm at times, so it was a pleasant stroll linking with the end of a <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/hike" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#hike</a> that I did a few years ago.
