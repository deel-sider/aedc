Recently spent some time exploring <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Glengarriff" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Glengarriff</a> and <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Adrigole" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Adrigole</a> in the Beara Peninsula. The scenery is fabulous, though there was boggy going on the <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Beara" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Beara</a> Way between Adrigole and Glengarriff. Going west from Adrigole to Castletown Beare now takes my fancy, even if that needs to wait and will likely need a stay in the area. Day trips from <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Cork" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Cork</a> do not work always.
