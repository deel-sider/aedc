Was in <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Wales" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Wales</a> again this weekend. Got some rain but a lot of dry weather as well. Not much visibility on top of Pumlumon Fawr but better elsewhere. <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Aberystwyth" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Aberystwyth</a> also looks promising, so another return cannot be ruled out when the weather offers.
