Telegraph Cove, a cherished site on North Vancouver Island, was devastated by a fire caused by a chewed wire, destroying key attractions like the Whale Interpretive Centre.

Funding efforts are ongoing to restore this beloved destination. <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/TelegraphCove" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#TelegraphCove</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/CommunitySupport" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#CommunitySupport</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Rebuild" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Rebuild</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/BritishColumbia" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#BritishColumbia</a> <a href="https://explore-mag.com/telegraph-cove-a-story-of-resilience-and-hope/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no">https://explore-mag.com/telegraph-cove-a-story-of-resilience-and-hope/</a>
