From <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Boston" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Boston</a> to San Francisco, urban hikers are creating Instant Urban Trails by stitching together parks and paths into beautiful, rigorous, and creative routes. The concept was introduced in San Francisco&#39;s <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Crosstown" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Crosstown</a> Trail, a 17-mile route that connects diverse natural spaces and neighbourhoods. Similar trails have since emerged in <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Seattle" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Seattle</a>, New York City, San Francisco (Double Cross Trail), <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Chicago" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Chicago</a>, and <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Denver" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Denver</a>. <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/destinations/north-america/instant-urban-hikes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no">https://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/destinations/north-america/instant-urban-hikes/</a>
