Very rainy evening here in <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Cork" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Cork</a>. Glad I was able to get out for a hike earlier. Got high tide warnings ongoing at the moment too. Noticed how high the water had risen along the shore over the last few days. Poses a risk of flooding in some parts too.
