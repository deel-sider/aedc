Archaeologists have uncovered a new Pharaonic tomb near Luxor, Egypt, the first in over 100 years. Initially believed to belong to a royal wife, it was confirmed as that of Pharaoh Thutmose II, dating to around 1493-1479 BCE. The discovery lacked treasures due to past interference. <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Archaeology" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Archaeology</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/AncientEgypt" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#AncientEgypt</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/ThutmoseII" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#ThutmoseII</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Luxor" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Luxor</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Wanderlust" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Wanderlust</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Discovery" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Discovery</a> <a href="https://www.wanderlustmagazine.com/news/archaeologists-discover-new-pharaonic-tomb-for-first-time-in-100-years/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no">https://www.wanderlustmagazine.com/news/archaeologists-discover-new-pharaonic-tomb-for-first-time-in-100-years/</a>
