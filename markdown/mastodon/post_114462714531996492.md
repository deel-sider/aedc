Helyg, Britain&#39;s oldest purpose-acquired climbing hut in Eryri/Snowdonia, turns 100 this May. Since 1925, this former roadmender&#39;s cottage has been a launchpad for legendary climbers, shelter from storms, and gathering place for generations. Its rich history includes service as a WWII &#39;Toughening School&#39; and continued relevance today. <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/BritishClimbing" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#BritishClimbing</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/MountainHeritage" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#MountainHeritage</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Snowdonia" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Snowdonia</a> <a href="https://www.thegreatoutdoorsmag.com/news/helyg-100-hut-british-climbing-eryri-snowdonia/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no">https://www.thegreatoutdoorsmag.com/news/helyg-100-hut-british-climbing-eryri-snowdonia/</a>
