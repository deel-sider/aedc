A festive escapade: This is a reflection on a festive season getaway that recounts experiences in Edinburgh and Aviemore. Storm Gerrit complicates the journey to Aviemore, but there was enjoyable hiking in Glen Eanaich and satisfying explorations of Inverness. A walk from Kingussie to Aviemore presented obstacles like fallen trees. The New Year&#39;s Eve hike around Loch an Eilean is peaceful, with pleasant photogenic weather. <a href="https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/2024/01/20/a-festive-escapade/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no">https://www.assortedexplorations.com/outdoors/2024/01/20/a-festive-escapade/</a>
