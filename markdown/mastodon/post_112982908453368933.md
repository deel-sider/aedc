The <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Ballyhoura" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Ballyhoura</a> Mountains also allowed for a day of hiking. An out and back walk from <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Ballyhea" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Ballyhea</a> and <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Seefin" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Seefin</a>, near <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Ardpatrick" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Ardpatrick</a>, will need a long day, though. Public transport makes it work from <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Cork" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Cork</a>, too.
