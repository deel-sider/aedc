Got heatwave here in the <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/UK" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#UK</a>. It may not be the best for hiking but I still want to make some use of it over the coming weekend. After an often wet summer, you need to use your chances when you get them, unless other things get in the way, that is.
