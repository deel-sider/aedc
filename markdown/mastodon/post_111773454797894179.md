The weather has taken on a much colder feel around the <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/UK" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#UK</a> recently. We even got some <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/snow" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#snow</a>, though most has gone around me. The dry interlude has become a respite from all the wet weather, even if it is not to last.
