Got out for a stroll around Kinsale today. Took in the Scilly walk and the Preghane loop. Sunshine came and went, yet there was plenty for photographic exploits, more than might have been forecast. Other possibilities like Tomies Wood in Killarney, Glengarriff and Galway had to wait but might have worked just as well. We all have to pick and choose according to what we can manage.
