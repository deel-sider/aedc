Was in <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Wales" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Wales</a> again this weekend. Hiked from <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Minffordd" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Minffordd</a> to Morfa Mawddach in hot sunny weather on Saturday. Went via the summit of Cadair Idris too. Overnighted in <a href="https://mstdn.social/tags/Porthmadog" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Porthmadog</a> before returning home on a Sunday of unsettled weather.
