### Outdoor Discoveries

[Examine Discoveries](/outdoors)

There have to be motivations for travel and everyone has their own set. What often draws me is the pursuit of quieter, emptier, wilder locations and that is what is at the heart of this part of the website. This comes from having had a sense of wonder at nature aroused by an English teacher and an appreciation for mountain and coastal scenery bequeathed to me by my parents.

Of course, the best way to experience a place is to take things slowly. It is for that reason that self-powered travel on foot or by bicycle is what I favour. Going any faster means that you miss out on so much and it also helps if you stop along the way to soak in the ambience of your situation.

In all of this, you need to be truly present in a location and not engrossed in the activity that you are pursuing. For some, it is the activity that matters but I take a more transcendental view for it is the spiritual and emotional experience that matters. For that, solitude and silence do come into their own.

Here, you will find tales of my wanderings around parts of the European and North American countryside as well as musing on related subjects like nature and equipment. This happened because of the encouragement of others when I had not realised our appetite for each others' stories. Throughout the travails of life, nature remains a place of restoration and that adds to the enduring memories of beauty that we often gain.
